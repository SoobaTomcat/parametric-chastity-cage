This is a major overhaul of [Dani119's parametric chastity cage](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2764421). It is designed to accommodate a Holy-Trainer-style lock, sometimes called a "stealth lock" or a "mortise lock". My volunteer tester says it's the most comfortable cage she's ever worn!

Changes from version 1: changed the opening at the tip from a hole to a slot, strengthened the area around the keyhole, changed the dovetail to a robust slot, added some options to improve printability, made it more customizable, and cleaned up the code a lot.

Customize it to your own dimensions in OpenSCAD! This thing is fully parametric! Included in the repository are easy-to-print, easy-to-use measurement tools also if you need them.

Feedback, suggestions, and remixes are more than welcome! **I have now removed the non-commercial clause from the CC license**. It was present on the original cage that I remixed from; but now the code is so completely distinct that I feel I can properly claim it as my own and license it as I see fit.
