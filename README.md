This is a major overhaul of [Dani119's parametric chastity cage](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2764421). It is designed to accommodate a Holy-Trainer-style lock. My volunteer tester says it's the most comfortable cage she's ever worn!

Changes from version 1: changed the opening at the tip from a hole to a slot, strengthened the area around the keyhole, changed the dovetail to a robust slot, added some options to improve printability, made it more customizable, and cleaned up the code a bit.

Customize it to your own dimensions in OpenSCAD! This thing is fully parametric! Here's a tip: The "cage-length" parameter should be about 16mm **shorter** than the target penis length.
